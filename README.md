## My process

### Built with

- [MUI](https://mui.com/) - components and style library
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Project builder

### What I learned

- How to customize MUI styles
- How to make a responsive text component that allows you to reduce the length of the text if it does not fit

### Continued development

I would like to focus on projects with animations as well as completely native components without using a UI-library.

### Useful resources

- [Password entropy calculator](https://generatepasswords.org/how-to-calculate-entropy/) - This helped me for calculate password strength reason. I see that it good algorithm to detect password strength and it's allow to calculate strength for any length of password.
